![Me](assets/me.png)

My name is Christopher Bertels and I'm a student at the [University of Osnabr√ºck](http://www.uos.de).
I study Computer Science and Philosophy.

I've written a bunch of free software, most of which you can find on my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/bakkdoor).

I'm also on Twitter:

* [@bakkdoor](https://twitter.com/bakkdoor)
* [@fancy_lang](https://twitter.com/fancy_lang) (for Fancy related stuff)

## Hobbies & Interests

I've been interested in programming language design and implementation for a long time. I prefer dynamic over static languages. I prefer implicit over explicit. Here's a list of languages I like and have used:

* Fancy (see below)
* Ruby
* Common Lisp
* Clojure
* Smalltalk

Other languages I have used and have a working knowledge of:

* C
* C++
* C#
* Java
* Python

Languages I've tried out and liked:

* Erlang
* Haskell

Apart from these I've played with many other languages, but did not write anything significant in them.

## Fancy

In my spare time I work on a new general-purpose programming language called [Fancy](http://fancy-lang.org). I started working on Fancy in January 2010 and have been working on it ever since.

This blog mostly talks about its development, new features and ideas related to it. Fancy runs on [Rubinius](http://rubini.us), a Ruby VM, and is mostly inspired by [Smalltalk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk), [Ruby](http://ruby-lang.org) and [Io](http://iolanguage.com).

It's a pure dynamic object-oriented programming language, with built-in support for concurrency (via [Futures][1] and [Actors][2]) and has first-class integration support for Ruby and any Ruby library, including all Ruby C-extensions supported by Rubinius.

## Work experience

In 2011, I did a 1 year internship at [BackType](http://backtype.com) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com) in San Francisco.

My internship started at BackType in January 2011 and was extended from 4 months to a full year. In July 2011 [BackType got acquired](http://techcrunch.com/2011/07/05/twitter-acquires-social-analytics-startup-backtype/) [by Twitter](http://blog.backtype.com/2011/07/backtype-has-been-acquired-by-twitter/), and I joined Twitter with the rest of the BackType team.

I led the web development part of Twitter's new [Web Analytics](https://dev.twitter.com/blog/introducing-twitter-web-analytics) app that our team of ex-BackType members worked on, among lots of other things.
